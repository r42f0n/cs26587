Final Project
Dataset
•       (Preferred)   Option   1:   Find your own data   set   of   interest.
If you   have   difficulties to find your   own data set of   interest,   you   can   consider   the   following two options.
•       Option   2: The   dataset for this   project   is collected   from   a   clinical   trial   by the   Mayo   Clinic   between   1974 and   1984   on studying   Primary Biliary Cirrhosis   (PBS). The   dataset can   be   downloaded from the website http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/pbc. Please   read the data description and variable definition   carefully on the website. 
•       Option   3: The   SEER   datasets.      Follow   the   instructions   on
https://seer.cancer.gov/data/ to   extract   the   SEER   datasets.    After extraction the   data files are   in the   incidence directory. The same directory contains the   important file seerdic.pdf that explains   the   meaning of the fields   in the   data files.   The SEER   database   is extremely   large   and you will   probably want to   subset   it. The www   site of the American Cancer Society   (www.cancer.org)   has a   great      deal of   interesting   information about cancer that   can   help   you choose   meaningful   projects.   Indeed the statistics on that site   are   obtained through analysis of the SEER   database.
Project Content 
You are to   use the   methods of this course to   analyze   your   selected   data   set. The   goal   of the   project   is to demonstrate   how   much survival   analysis you   have learned.   Projects   should   have the following components:
•             Some   preliminary elementary calculations   (Chapters 4,   5, and   7)
•             Some type of   regression   modeling   using   both a   Cox   proportional   hazards model   (Chapters 8-9)   and a   parametric   regression   model   (Chapter   12). The   results of these   models should   be   compared.
•             Model validation   using   residual   analysis   (Chapter   11 and Section   12.5) for   both the   proportional   hazards   and   parametric   regression   models.
•             Both categorical and   numerical variables, as well   as   some代 写STAT 5140 Fall 2024Matlab

•          An   interpretative   section   outlining your   important   conclusions   written   in      nontechnical   language,e.g. “Being   married   decreases   the   risk   of   breast cancer   by 40%”   instead of “The   coefficient of   marital status   is   -0.51 and   is   significant”   .   Note   log(.6)   =   -0.51.   It would   be   nice   if you   had some significant   interaction terms,   both categorical*categorical and   categorical*numerical, to   interpret. 
Final Report requirement 
The   project final   report should focus on data   introduction,   question to   answer, analysis techniques, and analysis   result   interpretation. The following format for the final   report   is suggested.
The final   report should   be no more than 15 pages from Section 1 to Section 5, without computing codes.    Computing   codes   should   be   attached   as   an appendix. The final   report should   be submitted to   Canvas website in pdf format. 
• Section   1:      Introduction to data.
•       Section   2:    Questions to   address.   Formulate appropriate   questions on   your   own that can   be   addressed   by analyzing this   dataset.
•       Section   3:    Statistical analysis. A technical section   describing   in   great         detail what you did.   Relevant   portions of   R/SAS   output should   be   ‘cut   and   pasted’   into this section. This section should   be   self-contained and   not   require   rummaging through   mounds   of output.   In   particular,      I should   not   have to   read   the   appendix   (see   below) to   know what you   did and to   assess the correctness of   your   analysis.
•       Section 4:    Interpret the   analysis   results   and   answer   the   question(s)   in Section   2.
•       Section 5:   Discussion on   limitation of the   analysis.       Pros/cons of the   used   methods.
•       Appendix: codes.
•       If you choose Option   3,   attached   a   copy   of your   SEER   confidentiality   agreement showing,   in the   upper   lefthand corner, you   name and number.
